## Definitions

### Ethics
*"[...] the criteria, norms, and values for human action and conduct" (Gomez and Jones, 2010)* 

### Positionality
*"[...] how we position ourselves and are positioned by others" (Gomez and Jones, 2010)* 

### Reflexivity
*"[...] the relationship we, as researchers, have with the world" (Gomez and Jones, 2010)* 

### Ontology
*The nature of reality* 
- Questions of existence; what does it mean 'to be'?  
- Fundamental assumptions about how the world works 
- Monism vs Dualism debate 
  - Monism: the world is made up of one thing, everything belongs together and is "formed from the same material or [...] subject to one overriding principle that governs their existence" (Gomez and Jones, 2010) 
    - e.g. the mind and body are united, humans and the natural world are intrinsically connected 
  - Dualism: There is a division between the ephemeral and the material, the spiritual and the physical 
    - e.g. the mind and body are separate, humans and the natural world are separate 
    - Dualism leads to binaries -- if a plant is a plant, it cannot be an animal; if something is natural, it is not cultured or social, or part of society 
      - This is a world of mutual exclusivity and polarity, and "incombatibility" 
        - Some of the most prominent dichotomies that dualist ontologies see in the world are:  
          - Mind and body 
          - Nature and culture 
          - Subject and object 
          - Reality and fantasy
          - Individual and society 
          - Space and time 
          - Self and other 
- Ontological questions deeply affect research methodologies; while a dualist can easily separate variables X and Y, a monist would struggle to find a way to isolate variables in a world where everything's connected and where phenomena are in relationships with other phenomena 

### Epistemology
*How we come to understand reality*
